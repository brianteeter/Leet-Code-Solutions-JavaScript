# LeetCodeSolutions:

The purpose of this repo is to have a nice place where I can work on and share solutions to LeetCode problems.  

LeetCode has 'taken over the world' of coding problems, and because of that employers place an inordinante amount of importance on the ability of developers to solve these coding puzzles.  So, since that's a thing now, I'm going to solve a ton of them and share here.  

I feel like LeetCode is not a terribly useful measure of a developer's ability.  But since it seems industry thinkis its important, and its a fun hobby anyway, I am going to work through a bunch of them.

## Languages Used

I'm a fan of JavaScript in general, so a lot of solutions will be written in JavaScript.  Where the solution is in JavaScript I'm using Mocha for my local testing so I can do some test cases before I submit then to LeetCode.  I also use WebStorm, because its awesome.  I've provided the /.idea/ files in this repo so anyone else who uses WebStorm can just clone and go.

Eventually I'll get _fancy_ and start to use some Java, C#, C++, Go, Rust, Python, or whatever in some of my solutions.  We'll see.  

## How to Use

- Make sure you have Node 10+ installed
- Clone this project
- Run: `npm i`
- Run: `mocha` to run tests

## Why?

LeetCode is neat and their interface is decent, but I like using a real IDE to write software.  So I do, then I copy it up to LeetCode and submit.  

Also, maybe if I make this public someone can benefit from sharing these solutions.
